# Sudoku Solver App
Welcome to the Sudoku Solver App! This project is a simple yet powerful application that solves Sudoku puzzles using JavaScript. The core logic is built upon recursion and backtracking techniques to efficiently find the solution to any valid Sudoku puzzle. The app also includes basic styling with CSS for a clean and user-friendly interface.

# Project Structure
The project consists of three main files:

index.html: The HTML file that structures the webpage and includes the necessary references to CSS and JavaScript files.

app.css: The CSS file that contains the styling for the Sudoku board and other UI elements. It ensures that the application is visually appealing and easy to use.

script.js: The JavaScript file where the Sudoku solving logic is implemented. This file harnesses the power of recursion and backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles.

# Features
Sudoku Solver: Solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties using advanced algorithms.

Recursion and Backtracking: The solver uses recursive functions and backtracking techniques to find the solution.

User Interface: Simple and clean design with an intuitive layout.


# Implementation Details
Recursion: The solver uses a recursive approach to try and fill in the Sudoku grid. It explores possible numbers for each cell and uses backtracking to undo changes when necessary.

Backtracking: If a number placement does not lead to a solution, the solver backtracks and tries a different number, ensuring that all possibilities are explored.
